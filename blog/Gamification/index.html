This communal discovery has become a go-to example that illustrates the benefits of ‘Gamification‘.</p> <p>Gamification can be defined as a process for integrating game mechanics into something that already exists to motivate participation, increase engagement and develop loyalty. This concept can be applied to a lot of segments that include your website, social media presence, day-to-day operations, customer engagement and more. It basically means taking the key elements of a game and its mechanics to apply them in different situations for varying objectives and to facilitate the attainment of results easily.</p> <p>An organization, be it a business or not, is essentially run by its people and to make them work to their best of potential is one of the difficult challenges faced regularly. Gamification introduces game design elements into non-game applications to make them fun and engaging. It uses competition, points, achievement, rules of play, status and self-expression to encourage actions through positive feedback.</p> <p>How it works: Imagine this. If you had an imaginary XP bar (a bar which accumulates your performance in terms of experience gained) on top of your head floating all day which would increase proportionately as per your performance. After gaining a certain amount of XP, you’d ‘Level Up’ according to the different tiers as per the theme of the job you’re doing, such as moving from a ‘Strawberry Shortcake Tier’ to a ‘Chocolate Patisserie Tier’ for a confectionary workplace. This would not only bring about a sense of belongingness towards the theme of the place and its goals but also motivate you constantly because you have a different rank and level to aim towards.</p> <p>(You can actually gamify your life through this app called ‘Life RPG’ available on Playstore)</p> <p>The idea of bringing in the game elements appeals to the human mind and makes work much more engaging and interesting, thereby motivating the employees and increasing their productivity which in turn would lead to an increase in their contribution towards the success of the business. It also makes the employees compete with one another on the basis of ranks, levels, badges, achievements and all possible aspects which you can draw from a game.</p> <p>How Deloitte Made Leadership Training “Addictive” for Senior Execs</p> <p>Deloitte had built a leadership training curriculum for senior executives but had trouble encouraging the senior executives to start and complete the program.</p> <p>So, Deloitte found the answer to this challenge in the vestiges of Gamification – they turned to Badgeville (a ‘software as a service’ company) to introduce gamified elements like badges, leaderboards and status symbols that measured how many executives were participating and completing courses.</p> <p>Gamification brought about changes in this situation! it made the average time to complete the training curriculum fall by 50 percent and the program saw a 46.6 percent increase in the number of users that returned to the site daily.</p> <p>As mentioned before, gamification is used in different organizational procedures in an ambition to promote better performance and boost superior results. (for example- see Microsoft’s use of gamification)</p> <p>You are probably wondering how and in what particular ways can gamification generate these impressive outcomes in businesses.</p> <p>It covers 4 aspects:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Engagement: Gamification helps employees track their work progress and realize their strengths and weaknesses. The visible goals, achievements and benchmarks create commitment and devotion within the employees thereby turning their experience into a fun and engaging activity. The recognition, status and acknowledgement they receive from gamified enterprises, drive employees to be motivated, outperform and improve their work. Leaderboards work as a great way to not only make them competitive but also boost their esteem by a display of different status.</p> </li> <li> <p>Learning and Training: Gamification can be a great catalyst for induction and training of employees. Gamified learning is usually be characterized by completion of tasks like going through learning materials, quizzes, simulations etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Adaptation: The business environment is dynamic and the only way to stay profitable in the long run is through ‘change’. By gamifying practices, we are using the same techniques that keep players interested and attached to a game. The competition along with excitement and willingness to move forward in the game keeps the users engaged in the process and encourages adaption of new changes.</p> </li> <li> <p>Alignment of Goals: Gamification aims at driving behaviours more than measuring them. The goals of the organization can be represented through the gamified ideas and motivate the employees to compete and collect more ‘points’, as it helps increase sales or achieve other organizational objectives. The leaderboard displays the points of every employee and ranks them. As the employees focus on gaining more points, they work towards the goals as well but this time not while being bored in the least. Gamification connects the organization’s and the employees’ objectives through motivation for feedback, rewards and achievements. It produces interactions that inspire employees to become better and better every day.</p> </li> </ol> </p> <p><strong>Recommended</strong> <a href="/blog/overvaluation/">» Overvaluation of Startups </a><br> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="footer" style=" display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(20,5%); grid-template-rows: repeat(20,5%); height: 40vh; "> <div class="footer-social footer-layout-social"> <small class="social"> <div> <span class="icons"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-collegiate-entrepreneurs-organisation-delhi-university/"> <span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0h-14c-2.761 0-5 2.239-5 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762 0 5-2.239 5-5v-14c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zm-11 19h-3v-11h3v11zm-1.5-12.268c-.966 0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zm13.5 12.268h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0v5.604h-3v-11h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476v6.759z"/></svg></span></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ceo_du"> <span class="icon icon--instagram"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><g><path d="M256 109.3c47.8 0 53.4 0.2 72.3 1 17.4 0.8 26.9 3.7 33.2 6.2 8.4 3.2 14.3 7.1 20.6 13.4 6.3 6.3 10.1 12.2 13.4 20.6 2.5 6.3 5.4 15.8 6.2 33.2 0.9 18.9 1 24.5 1 72.3s-0.2 53.4-1 72.3c-0.8 17.4-3.7 26.9-6.2 33.2 -3.2 8.4-7.1 14.3-13.4 20.6 -6.3 6.3-12.2 10.1-20.6 13.4 -6.3 2.5-15.8 5.4-33.2 6.2 -18.9 0.9-24.5 1-72.3 1s-53.4-0.2-72.3-1c-17.4-0.8-26.9-3.7-33.2-6.2 -8.4-3.2-14.3-7.1-20.6-13.4 -6.3-6.3-10.1-12.2-13.4-20.6 -2.5-6.3-5.4-15.8-6.2-33.2 -0.9-18.9-1-24.5-1-72.3s0.2-53.4 1-72.3c0.8-17.4 3.7-26.9 6.2-33.2 3.2-8.4 7.1-14.3 13.4-20.6 6.3-6.3 12.2-10.1 20.6-13.4 6.3-2.5 15.8-5.4 33.2-6.2C202.6 109.5 208.2 109.3 256 109.3M256 77.1c-48.6 0-54.7 0.2-73.8 1.1 -19 0.9-32.1 3.9-43.4 8.3 -11.8 4.6-21.7 10.7-31.7 20.6 -9.9 9.9-16.1 19.9-20.6 31.7 -4.4 11.4-7.4 24.4-8.3 43.4 -0.9 19.1-1.1 25.2-1.1 73.8 0 48.6 0.2 54.7 1.1 73.8 0.9 19 3.9 32.1 8.3 43.4 4.6 11.8 10.7 21.7 20.6 31.7 9.9 9.9 19.9 16.1 31.7 20.6 11.4 4.4 24.4 7.4 43.4 8.3 19.1 0.9 25.2 1.1 73.8 1.1s54.7-0.2 73.8-1.1c19-0.9 32.1-3.9 43.4-8.3 11.8-4.6 21.7-10.7 31.7-20.6 9.9-9.9 16.1-19.9 20.6-31.7 4.4-11.4 7.4-24.4 8.3-43.4 0.9-19.1 1.1-25.2 1.1-73.8s-0.2-54.7-1.1-73.8c-0.9-19-3.9-32.1-8.3-43.4 -4.6-11.8-10.7-21.7-20.6-31.7 -9.9-9.9-19.9-16.1-31.7-20.6 -11.4-4.4-24.4-7.4-43.4-8.3C310.7 77.3 304.6 77.1 256 77.1L256 77.1z"/><path d="M256 164.1c-50.7 0-91.9 41.1-91.9 91.9s41.1 91.9 91.9 91.9 91.9-41.1 91.9-91.9S306.7 164.1 256 164.1zM256 315.6c-32.9 0-59.6-26.7-59.6-59.6s26.7-59.6 59.6-59.6 59.6 26.7 59.6 59.6S288.9 315.6 256 315.6z"/><circle cx="351.5" cy="160.5" r="21.5"/></g></svg> </span></a> </span> <form action="https://formspree.io/xeqrjbrn" method="POST"> <input type="email" name="replyto" id="Email" placeholder="Mailing List Email" class="email" required> <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://ceodu.github.io/thanks/" /> <input type="submit" value="Join"> </form> </div> </small> </div> <div class="footer-layout-text"> <h1 style="color: #fff; margin:0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing: 0.05rem;">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation</h1> <h1 style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing: 0.05rem; font-size: 3rem;">Delhi University</h1> </div> <div class="footer-layout-copy"> &copy; CEO, Delhi University </div> </footer> <script async src=""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', ''); </script> <!-- Rotator --> </body>
