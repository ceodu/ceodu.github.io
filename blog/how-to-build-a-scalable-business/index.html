The best way to understand the process of innovation is to witness it in action. Past trends are instrumental in understanding the needs of the future and preparing yourself for the dynamic and high frequency environment that surrounds innovation and entrepreneurship in the current age.</p> <p>So, before we delve into the logistics behind creating and running a successful business, let’s take a moment to understand what sorts of businesses end up being successful.</p> <p>In the past 10 years, millions of startups have been launched. Some go on to become tech-giants like Uber while some fail to come into the limelight and slowly fade away. What factors in play decide which startup will make it big and which won’t is a question that lingers even today.</p> <p>Let’s create a list of some famous tech startups that didn’t exist 10 years ago</p> <p>Uber – 120 billion dollars IPO estimated Airbnb – Valued at 38 billion dollars Dropbox – valued at 12 billion dollars Square Payments – valued at 17 billion dollars Snapchat – Valued at 16 billion dollars Cloudera – Valued at 5.3 billion dollars Spotify – valued at 23.5 billion dollars These constitute as part of the most successful startups launched within the past decade.</p> <p>All these startups have 1 thing in common – They were the first ones to enter their industry.</p> <p>Uber entered the transportation industry back in 2008 (before lyft, ola, etc were even ideated)</p> <p>They created an industry for themselves. Their USP was not just providing cabs at the click of a button, it was the ease and comfort of transportation. They did something no one was doing.</p> <p>Companies like Airbnb , Dropbox, Square Payments , Snapchat, Cloudera and spotify Provided people with a new service or a product. Something Unique. And that is exactly what successful businesses do.</p> <p>Every entrepreneur has two choices to make –</p> <p>Either make something new, or Improve something that already exists Peter Thiel in his new book Zero to one stresses upon asking oneself one basic question –</p> <p>WHAT VALUABLE COMPANY IS NOBODY BUILDING? It is rightly mentioned-</p> <p>“The next Bill Gates will not build an operating system. The next Mark Zuckerberg will not build a social network . The next larry page or sergey brin won’t make a search engine. If you are copying these guys, you aren’t learning from them “</p> <p>So, the first step to follow while thinking of building a company is ask yourself</p> <p>What can i do that nobody is doing?</p> <p>There are millions of great and unique ideas that can satisfy the needs and wants of a potential customer. The intersection of “ What you are capable of doing “ and “ What do people need “ is your unique product.</p> <p>To be a successful company is to reach somewhere first and have a monopoly market.</p> <p>Unlike the conventional meaning of monopoly which signifies a market with a single seller and consequently no close or distant substitutes, markets nowadays are rarely traditional monopolies. Thus, rather than focussing on something that no one else can make, focus on making something so good that even if competition arises, you remain irreplaceable</p> <p>This is called Modern Monopoly. Thiel characterises it as follows-</p> <p>Having or developing a proprietary technology that outperforms what is currently available Developing a network (or platform) so that users are more likely to use your product Potential to scale and operate in large markets and with lots of users Creating a strong brand that touches every point of the customer experience Thus monopoly is not only confined to the uniqueness of a product, it is expandable to the way of doing business. Apart from a technologically superior product, monopoly may include customer experience, after sales services, etc.</p> <p>In conclusion, the first step to creating a scalable business is to either do something no one else is doing or improve an existing product to the extent that it becomes unique and proprietary to and it outperforms anything that currently exists and is able to generate a tangible market share.</p> <p>In the subsequent posts we discuss the other indicators of a successful startup.</p> </p> <p><strong>Recommended</strong> <a href="/blog/overvaluation/">» Overvaluation of Startups </a><br> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="footer" style=" display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(20,5%); grid-template-rows: repeat(20,5%); height: 40vh; "> <div class="footer-social footer-layout-social"> <small class="social"> <div> <span class="icons"> <a href="https://twitter.com/shivansh3121"> <span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><path d="M419.6 168.6c-11.7 5.2-24.2 8.7-37.4 10.2 13.4-8.1 23.8-20.8 28.6-36 -12.6 7.5-26.5 12.9-41.3 15.8 -11.9-12.6-28.8-20.6-47.5-20.6 -42 0-72.9 39.2-63.4 79.9 -54.1-2.7-102.1-28.6-134.2-68 -17 29.2-8.8 67.5 20.1 86.9 -10.7-0.3-20.7-3.3-29.5-8.1 -0.7 30.2 20.9 58.4 52.2 64.6 -9.2 2.5-19.2 3.1-29.4 1.1 8.3 25.9 32.3 44.7 60.8 45.2 -27.4 21.4-61.8 31-96.4 27 28.8 18.5 63 29.2 99.8 29.2 120.8 0 189.1-102.1 185-193.6C399.9 193.1 410.9 181.7 419.6 168.6z"/></svg> </span></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ceodu"> <span class="icon icon--instagram"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><g><path d="M256 109.3c47.8 0 53.4 0.2 72.3 1 17.4 0.8 26.9 3.7 33.2 6.2 8.4 3.2 14.3 7.1 20.6 13.4 6.3 6.3 10.1 12.2 13.4 20.6 2.5 6.3 5.4 15.8 6.2 33.2 0.9 18.9 1 24.5 1 72.3s-0.2 53.4-1 72.3c-0.8 17.4-3.7 26.9-6.2 33.2 -3.2 8.4-7.1 14.3-13.4 20.6 -6.3 6.3-12.2 10.1-20.6 13.4 -6.3 2.5-15.8 5.4-33.2 6.2 -18.9 0.9-24.5 1-72.3 1s-53.4-0.2-72.3-1c-17.4-0.8-26.9-3.7-33.2-6.2 -8.4-3.2-14.3-7.1-20.6-13.4 -6.3-6.3-10.1-12.2-13.4-20.6 -2.5-6.3-5.4-15.8-6.2-33.2 -0.9-18.9-1-24.5-1-72.3s0.2-53.4 1-72.3c0.8-17.4 3.7-26.9 6.2-33.2 3.2-8.4 7.1-14.3 13.4-20.6 6.3-6.3 12.2-10.1 20.6-13.4 6.3-2.5 15.8-5.4 33.2-6.2C202.6 109.5 208.2 109.3 256 109.3M256 77.1c-48.6 0-54.7 0.2-73.8 1.1 -19 0.9-32.1 3.9-43.4 8.3 -11.8 4.6-21.7 10.7-31.7 20.6 -9.9 9.9-16.1 19.9-20.6 31.7 -4.4 11.4-7.4 24.4-8.3 43.4 -0.9 19.1-1.1 25.2-1.1 73.8 0 48.6 0.2 54.7 1.1 73.8 0.9 19 3.9 32.1 8.3 43.4 4.6 11.8 10.7 21.7 20.6 31.7 9.9 9.9 19.9 16.1 31.7 20.6 11.4 4.4 24.4 7.4 43.4 8.3 19.1 0.9 25.2 1.1 73.8 1.1s54.7-0.2 73.8-1.1c19-0.9 32.1-3.9 43.4-8.3 11.8-4.6 21.7-10.7 31.7-20.6 9.9-9.9 16.1-19.9 20.6-31.7 4.4-11.4 7.4-24.4 8.3-43.4 0.9-19.1 1.1-25.2 1.1-73.8s-0.2-54.7-1.1-73.8c-0.9-19-3.9-32.1-8.3-43.4 -4.6-11.8-10.7-21.7-20.6-31.7 -9.9-9.9-19.9-16.1-31.7-20.6 -11.4-4.4-24.4-7.4-43.4-8.3C310.7 77.3 304.6 77.1 256 77.1L256 77.1z"/><path d="M256 164.1c-50.7 0-91.9 41.1-91.9 91.9s41.1 91.9 91.9 91.9 91.9-41.1 91.9-91.9S306.7 164.1 256 164.1zM256 315.6c-32.9 0-59.6-26.7-59.6-59.6s26.7-59.6 59.6-59.6 59.6 26.7 59.6 59.6S288.9 315.6 256 315.6z"/><circle cx="351.5" cy="160.5" r="21.5"/></g></svg> </span></a> </span> <form action="https://formspree.io/xeqrjbrn" method="POST"> <input type="email" name="replyto" id="Email" placeholder="Mailing List Email" class="email" required> <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://ceodu.github.io/thanks/" /> <input type="submit" value="Join"> </form> </div> </small> </div> <div class="footer-layout-text"> <h1 style="color: #fff; margin:0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing: 0.05rem;">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation</h1> <h1 style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing: 0.05rem; font-size: 3rem;">Delhi University</h1> </div> <div class="footer-layout-copy"> &copy; CEO, Delhi University </div> </footer> <script async src=""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', ''); </script> <!-- Rotator --> </body>
