So I tell you, I think this stems from the fact that, um, you know, as a society, we have, uh, gendered everything and we also, our concept of gender is also very skewed. So, we think the only two definitions , only two Genders that the human being can potentially fall into is of a man or a woman, and that is identified by your body. Uh, but your body has nothing to do with how you experience gender, how you feel about yourself, um, and things like that. So I think one of the first and the foremost things is for us, as a society, is to kind of unlearn what is gender really, because if we understood gender, then we wouldn’t make such a big fuss about being trans, and I think the second thing, and it’s more relevant to India itself is how we view the transgender community. Uh, historically you’ve seen transgender. People are living in boarding, begging in sex work because as a society, we want to push them to that extreme Uh, so in, in that case, I think the parents’ biggest fear and we see this because a lot of them do speak to us and we try and counsel them as well. One of the biggest fears they see is that if my, my son or my daughter transitions, uh, transitions, and if they become a transman or trans woman, uh, in that case, will my child also get involved in begging will they also be forced into sex work and things like that. So I think we need to show parents and others, and like families and society at large, we need to show them a better way of living. We need to show them that, uh, being transgender does not mean that this is what your life is, and this is where you will be. If we can undo some of those things. I think it’ll be much better and I think beyond all of that the biggest thing is, I mean, your child is your child, right? So it does not matter if your child grows up to identify as trans or gender fluid or gay or lesbian : at the end of the day, it’s your child. So why would you ever, uh, and most of them do it because of the fear of the society. So just because we fear what society will think , we cannot stop living our lives. So, yeah, I think that’s, that’s really it,</p> <p><b>QUESTION 2:</b></p> <p><b>Do you feel the trans community are marginalized at schools as their peers aren’t sensitized about the issue ?</b></p> <p>I’ll give you an example. Um, I think most of us have experienced this. So when I was growing up also, when I was in a school, there was always this one guy in my class who was very feminine, but People would taunt him and ask Why are you not playing with the boys? Why are you not playing sports, et cetera, uh, this person. And, uh, we found out just about two years ago that this person actually grew up to identify as a transgender woman and dropped out of schooling, he , dropped out of school because of all of this. What specifically was the reason we don’t know, but this person just went missing in school at like, I think 11th or something like that. And this is what actually happens with a lot of transgender people and also happens to a lot of people who identify as gay or because they come across so different, right. That those students next to them itself constantly keep making fun of them. And they eventually ended up leaving education. And then we ask them that, why are you begging, why aren’t you going? And, uh, you know, getting a job or something like that. I think that’s one aspect also that if you’re really focused on, you know, sensitizing and breaking all these norms about gender, sexuality, all of that at a very young age, it would make things better. I also feel that the teachers are involved. I think they’re the first people that we learn everything from, especially at a very young age, um, then being aware then being sensitized, the most important thing, if, because a lot of these kids who get harassed, they get harassed in front of the teachers as well and when we see teachers not taking an action, when we see the school management, not doing anything right now, the government has also launched a scheme, which every school in this, uh, in the country should have a gender neutral toilet, should identify transgender students and create a sepcial avenue for them so that they don’t drop out. How many schools that are actually following it. We really don’t know. So there’s only so much that the government can also do, but the management, uh, you know, the different stakeholders involved at the ground level should be actually be working</p> <p><b>QUESTION 3:</b></p> <p><b>The government came up with this law that one needs to have a certificate of a surgery in order to identify as a trans. Now, do you think that is kind of valid and what else the government should do, what else the government can do ?</b></p> <p>So I think that is slightly misunderstood. Um, because I think someone who was working on the ground,We see the reality very differently. What’s portrayed on the media is very, very different. the media just wants to make an interesting story and that is what the media is doing these days, Yeah. So the law really says that for anybody to avail a trans ID card, they can do it without the surgery. what do you need the surgery for is if you need your ID card in the name, in the gender identity of a man or a woman That is a bit conflicting, but what we’re trying to establish, what the government is trying to establish is that there is a difference between people who pre-transition. And then there is a difference between people who post transition. In a utopian world, We wouldn’t want that difference at all, because at the end of the day one should be allowed to experience gender however, they feel like without going through a surgery or not. But right now the system and the processes are not that simplified as yet. I’ll give you an example of this, right? Like you take a trans man. For example, a trans man is someone who was biologically assigned female at birth. This person grows up to identify as a man. Now, what if this person says that I’m okay to give birth? However, I would, my gender that I wanted to affirm should be that of a man as a country. Are we still in a place where we can understand a man or gender identity of a man giving birth, there are too many complications to things like that. And there are too many layers to it. So what the government essentially is doing is that they’re not ruling out the fact that you can’t get a trans ID card, anybody who self identifies they go through a psychiatric evaluation, which is what is a normal procedure, even in different cities and States at this point because what transgender people experience sometimes it might be on the borderline with experiencing another things as well. So they go to a mandatory psychiatric evaluation, uh, post which they get a certificate saying that, yes, I’m experiencing gender dysphoria or gender incongruence. And then I get my, uh, trans ID. So getting the trans ID is pretty simple, but if I don’t want a trans ID and if I were a trans man, and I said that, I just want my ID card to say that of a man, then I need to go through a surgery. So there are some people in the community who accept this, but there are some who don’t.There are a lot more legal and judicial issues to things like these as well.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 4:</b></p> <p><b>Does a lot of the ostracization that the trans community faces stems from the fact that they come from very, very backward families ?</b></p> <p>Yeah. Yeah. You know, I used to think more or less the same way that, uh, people who identify as trans and then who come from middle class or upper middle class, or the elite would have it easier versus those from the very grassroots, but it’s actually the other way around. Um, uh, it’s like, uh, I mean,the rich actually worry more about what society thinks uh, it actually works the same way. We see a lot more trans people who come from very affluent families find it extremely difficult, like in the sense they have all the protection and care, but they just cannot, they just cannot come out. They can not experience this in front of them. They cannot tell their relatives about it. Uh, they cannot come out. They cannot, uh, be in a family function, uh, in an express themselves the way that they want to, what we see with the very marginalized. I mean, the very grassroots level of our society is, uh, I, I think they’ve seen and they’ve exposed a lot more, even if you take, uh, sorry. Even if you take, uh, the whole, uh, system, you know, if, if you see where the government has placed all these camps or all these housing boards where trans people can stay, it is mostly in the slum boards. It is mostly in the areas where the, you know, lower middle class or the people on the poverty lines. And they are so much more exposed to seeing the trans community, et cetera. The acceptance is a lot better. Uh, nevertheless there are challenges on both ends. And I think at the end of the day, it comes down to the person finding the right resource. Like we had this girl who came to us, uh, uh, her name is Ajita and I’ve actually written a blog about her. She came from this very small village, very close to Salem in Tamil Nadu. And she ran away from her house because her village was really small, like some, one 50 people. And, uh, you know, her coming out and she’s looked at as a man, right in the village, she was already mocked upon so much because she doesn’t have a father. And in the village kept saying that, you know, your father died because you are so feminine, your father died because you wear nail Polish and things like that, so it’s better that you also die. And she was like, I cannot ever come out as a woman in my village. And so she ran away, he ran away, she came to Chennai. She had no idea where to go. She did a Google search and somehow she found us. Um, and from there on her journey started, we gave her some training, uh, placed her in Accenture, where she has been working for over a year now.And then she went back to her village as a transgender woman, uh, you know, carrying a lot of those gifts, et cetera, for her family, for her, her mother, and some of the other people in the, in the village. And nobody spoke a word. Uh, um, I’m not saying that if you become financially independent, everything, all your problems solved. Uh, but I think that’s the, one of the best gateways that we have, uh, possible. And the only thing that we really can do is really spread the awareness at the various levels, whether it’s a Metro cities, dial one, dial to towns, et cetera, that there are organizations that are people that can help. So please just don’t go anywhere else. Like if agita did not find us, she would have probably been into begging and sex work at this point. And she would have thought, okay, this is my life. So, yeah.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 5:</b></p> <p><b>How would you feel to see your state, our state pass a non-discrimination law that explicitly recognizes rights of LGBT people?</b></p> <p>Yeah. Yeah, I think that would be, it would be amazing, uh, because the government of a country recognizes trans people and at least protects the rights to some extent, but we’ve completely invalidated LGBT and larger queer community because, um, the government still believes that this is something that is against the order of the nature or whatever. Uh, so I think a statement like that, uh, build a very strong, uh, movement like that passing would be incredible. Um, the rights of our country protects everybody regardless. Uh, but it does not explicitly. And it is important when you are a marginalized community. It should explicitly say that say Dalits cannot be much less on the account of XYZ and similarly for trans people , you know, all of those things. So I think it would be great. Um, the trans bill of rights already has some of those things mentioned. Uh, but again, it caters only to the transgender community., we don’t, you know, completely validate the entire LGBTQ spectrum as yet as a country,</p> <p><b>QUESTION 6:</b></p> <p><b>Has it become easier to approach or companies or to even persuade, the people who are living in these marginalized areas that you can help them? Is it becoming easier or it’s still as difficult ?</b></p> <p>It has definitely become a lot more easier. Uh, I still remember when we started off in 2017, it was me and another friend of mine who would just go door to door, knock different houses of, uh, you know, these Slums where trans people stay, we’ll go there and we’ll be like, okay, we want to talk to you. This is what we’re doing. And nobody trusted us because the community has been used and abused in so many ways for decades together that for them to see a random person knocking at their doorstep and think that, you know, a good job will be available and their lives will i,prove they just can’t believe it because everybody’s basically use them for photo op or 400 other things. Um, yeah, but it took us some time. Uh, we had to create a lot of positive stories. We had to show work and results to gain the trust of the community. And right now it has become a lot better. In fact, right now we don’t do any sort of an outreach to identify trans people who want jobs. The community reaches out to us directly, uh, through word of mouth, through our website. Uh, and there are so many people that were getting jobs at this point and the community is so tightly knit, so one person gets the job in an inclusive workspace and they’re actually able to become financially independent. They go and tell another 20 people about it. So that way, yes, I think in terms of corporates, it’s still building up. Um, there is a gap between what the corporates expect in terms of skill and what we’re supposed to provide. So our training arm is something that is becoming a little bit more robust day by day, and we’re trying to solve that problem. Uh, but I think 2021 is, uh, it is a great year to be doing this work compared to the time when we started.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 7:</b></p> <p><b>How did,COVID-19 affect your operations? Was it that you really had to work hard to overcome, or you could transition, into the digital mode of working seamlessly?</b></p> <p>It wasn’t seamless at all. Um, because the community that we’re working with is also not so, you know, so digitally equipped as well, like, um, even within the trans community, you have so many layers, right? There are some who are educated, so they can manage, uh, but 40 50% is not that educated. So beyond tik tok or using Facebook, you know, working through all of these teams and coming for training, all of that, wasn’t easy. So remember, I think when COVID hit, uh, we put our residential training programs completely on hold, uh, about 60 people who were supposed to get jobs, uh, during the month of March, April, 2020, we had to stop all of that. Um, and then we told them, you know what, let’s just wait for a few months that should settle down. And then June rent and July rent and August went, and then we were like, nothing’s happening. And it doesn’t look like it’s going to get better anytime soon. Uh, so what’s really tough. An initial four or five months, all we were doing was only relief work. Uh, so people who were in very difficult situations, we were sending our food materials. We were raising donations and sending money to their families and et cetera. Uh, I think by August, September, we realized that we have to definitely transition. And the move also came from the community saying that, you know what, now we don’t think we even have begging as an option to really survive. We need to do something else in our life. Uh, so a lot of them came forward saying that, uh, you know, we will learn. So we onboarded a bunch of, um, local speaking,, trainers proficient in spoken Hindi, English, kannada, we got them on board. So first couple of days, we didn’t do trainings per se. We were just engaging them will be like a half an hour of catching up playing activities. And then going from the second week onwards we started doing proper English curriculum training and it actually worked out really well for us. Uh, so right now, like about 70% of all our trainings, everything is happening online, or we just reserved some percent of doing things offline because now things are again getting back to normal. And there are some people who still prefer coming in person and people are also getting the jobs online. So that transitions have also been happening. Uh, and I, I would say this is only because of the resilience of the community that we could act on something like this.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 8:</b></p> <p><b>This also speaks volumes about the perseverance that you have, your mission has. Uh, and, uh, so you gave this quote by someone that, uh, it’s not important to do well, but it’s more important to do good as well. So we see that you are completely driven by our mission, but in 2017, when you had to make this jump from Goldman Sachs, was it easy or how did you really, you know, (how did you) convince everyone that I knew that( setting up periferry )was something that was needed to be done, your family, uh, people around you.</b></p> <p>Yeah. So I’ll be, I’ll be very honest. So I do come from a place of privilege, right? It wasnt like , I had to support my family or anything like that, my family was self sufficient. So all I needed to do was be financially independent for myself and, uh, ensure that I have a, I mean, I have a career or whatever in case. So I think that itself kind of set things apart because I see a lot of people who have ambition and who have, you know, who have the willingness to do things, but they’re so stuck because they have so many other priorities to take care. So I think that kind of, that was one thing that stood out for me. And the second thing was, I never really announced it to anyone that I was going to do this, because just imagine, or like, if I told my family that I’m going to jump from Goldman to being in the social development sector and then specifically working for trans community, I don’t think this would have ever happened.So, uh, th the way I did this was, I don’t have parents I’m quitting the job. And then because I wanted to join the family business, that’s what I told them initially. And then slowly, little by little as I started getting more comfortable with the work I was doing, I would spend like three, four hours out of my family business every day, just go out on the field, volunteer, understand what’s happening. I started building an MVP or minimum viable product. I started people and getting people jobs even before Periferry was officially set up. So the thing is I had good amount of groundwork done, uh, for me to come up to my parents and say that here, this works, uh, because otherwise it’s not, I mean, I would think I would be unreasonable for them to expect it to, you know, to be completely okay with it.So I, I did some groundwork. I had some proof of concept and when things actually became in the shape of an organization, that’s when I actually announced it to them, not when I was starting off. And for me personally, um, I wanted to be in Goldman mainly for the exposure, uh, and definitely for the salary as well. But I think over a point, it didn’t matter, uh, you know, after working there for a year or so, I realized that I wasn’t, you know, really loving what I was doing. And I wanted to be in a place where I could actually be financially independent. And I knew that being in the development sector can, and social entrepreneurship was growing at this point. So, yeah, I didn’t think too much about it.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 9:</b></p> <p><b>One of the most difficult aspects of working with LGBT community is the question of family acceptance. So how important is it to integrate families in the support of LGBT and how can we do it? Get the family of trans community to support them?</b></p> <p>I think we should definitely talk about that. Uh, so I think, like I said, right, uh, the biggest fear that the parents also have, like, it’s two things, right? One is, Oh, what will my child end up doing? If they come out as trans or they come out as gay or, like, will they get accepted? Will they have a job? Where will they be pushed into et cetera? That is one fear. And second is what will people think And all of that, I think the second thing becomes a lot more easier to handle when the first thing is sort of taken care of, uh, which is what we, you know, motivate and, uh, help most of the candidates who reach out to us for jobs. Also, do they tell us I want to completely transition into a man or a woman, et cetera. And we tell them that, listen, just become financially independent into a place that you can take care of yourself. And, you know, you come across as someone who, who is strong all alone, uh, because when you do that getting because when you are independent, I think finding acceptance from others is a lot more easier. And I think another thing that happens within the community or not is sometimes people don’t accept themselves. And I don’t blame them for that because everybody around you is rejecting and everybody around you is too negative of who you are. The self acceptance becomes such a big problem. Um, I know that people are some of the people who have, you know, made peace with their families were able to do that because they really loved and accepted themselves as who they were. They were really proud of who they were. Uh, and I think when you are proud, when you are bored, when you are happy with who you are, right. Uh, getting people around you to understand that takes time, but it is, it is definitely possible as well. I hope that helps.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 10:</b></p> <p><b>Yeah, that’s cool. Uh, right. The choices you have made that. So commendable and, uh, what I would now ask is that we all are college students and what can we do, uh, right now, uh, how can we improve ourselves, develop ourselves, do you know, further down the line that even we have the courage to make the choices that you have made to, you know, so what really inspires you to do all this and how have you been able to make these choices?</b></p> <p>Yeah, I think also when I look at my own college days or whatever, I was someone who always explored and by exploring, I don’t mean going to different, different cities and countries and all of that. I didn’t have that sort of a financial bandwidth or whatever, but even within the college campus that I remember that, you know, my friends and everyone will be like, uh we have to get out of the college and go out and party or whatever, or go to a cafe and chill out. But me and a bunch of others would be like, okay, let’s go join NSS. Let’s be a part of the rotaract club. You know, let’s see what’s happening in the drama club, et cetera. And it’s not just because I randomly wanted to explore everything because there was a curiosity.Uh, there was a willingness to learn something new and, and somewhere deep down, I always wanted to challenge myself as well. I couldn’t see myself settling and being okay with okay. . I don’t think I saw my life that way. And I constantly kept challenging myself. I was extremely curious about a lot of things as well. So that really helped me, I feel beyond that, I think at the end of the day, it just comes down to having a lot of courage. Like some of the choices that I made, it could have gone the other way around as well, maybe Periferry as a startup would have never been successful. Maybe we never made it to folks or whatever. Now I’m, I’m happily speaking about it, but I also could have been in a place where all of this wouldn’t have worked and I would have stopped doing it.Maybe I gave up on the way. Uh, but at the end of the day, I still had the courage to make that choice, not knowing whether it will go which way. So I think this is the age that you guys can explore. Our twenties are really the time where you have all the, as much freedom as possible to really explore financially, to explore in terms of, uh, your own skills and meet a lot of people, do things that make you very, very uncomfortable because that’s the only way to really grow. And at the end of the day, have a lot of courage to really pursue what you want. You can do all of this independently without having to depend on your family or your parents for their support. All right. Thank you so much. It’s really has been a very engaging session and I’m learning quite a lot out of it. Uh, but there’s this one question that we need to ask you that what do you do in your free time? It’s it looks really, you know, from the conversation we are having, it looks quite, uh, different, but this is something I think our readers would also want to know that how are you developing in your free time as well besides doing this? So, Yeah, it is not a very great answer, but I, I have not had free time as much in the last one to two years. Um, you know, I’m still building a startup that I’m still reading a growing startup and a startup that is gaining a lot of focus. So 90, 99.9% of my time just goes in my startup which is the reason why even on a Sunday, I have to, you know, move all my interviews or whatever, extra sort of out of my day-to-day work. Uh, so the time is packed the little time that I get, I play Ukelele I’ve picked up a new hobby in the last, uh, last six months. So I started learning how to play Ukelele, and I enjoy it because it gives me some peace of mind, you know, apart from my day-to-day, uh, things that keeps happening. I, uh, I have three cats at home, so they’re my favorite, uh, place to be. Um, I wanted to adopt a few more dogs as well, but my parents were like to survive the culture before you started getting more animals. Um, and, uh, yeah, I spend time with my friends and I love, I love hanging out with my friends. My friends are those, uh, that I’ve known for like very, very long time and, uh, go back to childhood. still connect with them like on weekends or whatever. And I enjoy watching movies in the theater. I think that transports me to another world and, uh, takes me away from everything for a little while the other three or four things that I kind of enjoy doing.</p> <p><b>QUESTION 11:</b></p> <p><b>Right, So I think we have taken quite a lot of your time. So one last question before you leave, uh, now someone, uh, suppose that there is someone who is also working in an MNC or in the Goldman Sachs somewhere, and he too faces this choice in his life that he can do something, uh, for the betterment of the society as a whole. So what message would you give to him that he should make this leap?</b></p> <p>Yeah. See, I don’t want to pass a comment saying you know, make the transition from a MNC and life would be great for you because everyone’s reality is very different. But what I can say is that you, we can be an entrepreneur no matter where we are. Uh, even if you are an employee in Goldman Sachs, you can still be an entrepreneur as well. And that, that is exactly what I did when I was at Goldman. I did not stop at my day job. Uh, I was a part of the LGBT network over there. I spent a lot of time, uh, you know, exploring things, learning from the community and doing a lot of things outside as well. Right. So I had my own identity and I would say, act like an entrepreneur, uh, do not submit yourself into, um, you know, do not submit yourself into whatever’s happening Own your life, uh, is what I would say. Otherwise, there’ll be other people who will own it for you. Um, so yeah, I think that’s, that’s it. And if you feel like your leap will make things in life, better for you, if that’s the life that you want, because the life of an entrepreneur is not easy, either, there is a lot of things that you have to sacrifice and give up, but if you’re okay with that barter system, you know, and if you’re okay with sacrificing a lot of things, for making impact for having a bigger purpose innovation, then, then you should do it. So to sum it up, you know, act like an entrepreneur, wherever you go, um, make the leap. If that’s the life that you really want at the end of the day, and do not submit into that, this is what my life is, uh, control your life for yourself.</p> </p> <p><strong>Recommended</strong> <a href="/blog/Gaurav-Parchani/">» Interview with Gaurav Parchani </a><br> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="footer" style=" display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(20,5%); grid-template-rows: repeat(20,5%); height: 40vh; "> <div class="footer-social footer-layout-social"> <small class="social"> <div> <span class="icons"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-collegiate-entrepreneurs-organisation-delhi-university/"> <span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0h-14c-2.761 0-5 2.239-5 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762 0 5-2.239 5-5v-14c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zm-11 19h-3v-11h3v11zm-1.5-12.268c-.966 0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zm13.5 12.268h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0v5.604h-3v-11h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476v6.759z"/></svg></span></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ceo_du"> <span class="icon icon--instagram"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><g><path d="M256 109.3c47.8 0 53.4 0.2 72.3 1 17.4 0.8 26.9 3.7 33.2 6.2 8.4 3.2 14.3 7.1 20.6 13.4 6.3 6.3 10.1 12.2 13.4 20.6 2.5 6.3 5.4 15.8 6.2 33.2 0.9 18.9 1 24.5 1 72.3s-0.2 53.4-1 72.3c-0.8 17.4-3.7 26.9-6.2 33.2 -3.2 8.4-7.1 14.3-13.4 20.6 -6.3 6.3-12.2 10.1-20.6 13.4 -6.3 2.5-15.8 5.4-33.2 6.2 -18.9 0.9-24.5 1-72.3 1s-53.4-0.2-72.3-1c-17.4-0.8-26.9-3.7-33.2-6.2 -8.4-3.2-14.3-7.1-20.6-13.4 -6.3-6.3-10.1-12.2-13.4-20.6 -2.5-6.3-5.4-15.8-6.2-33.2 -0.9-18.9-1-24.5-1-72.3s0.2-53.4 1-72.3c0.8-17.4 3.7-26.9 6.2-33.2 3.2-8.4 7.1-14.3 13.4-20.6 6.3-6.3 12.2-10.1 20.6-13.4 6.3-2.5 15.8-5.4 33.2-6.2C202.6 109.5 208.2 109.3 256 109.3M256 77.1c-48.6 0-54.7 0.2-73.8 1.1 -19 0.9-32.1 3.9-43.4 8.3 -11.8 4.6-21.7 10.7-31.7 20.6 -9.9 9.9-16.1 19.9-20.6 31.7 -4.4 11.4-7.4 24.4-8.3 43.4 -0.9 19.1-1.1 25.2-1.1 73.8 0 48.6 0.2 54.7 1.1 73.8 0.9 19 3.9 32.1 8.3 43.4 4.6 11.8 10.7 21.7 20.6 31.7 9.9 9.9 19.9 16.1 31.7 20.6 11.4 4.4 24.4 7.4 43.4 8.3 19.1 0.9 25.2 1.1 73.8 1.1s54.7-0.2 73.8-1.1c19-0.9 32.1-3.9 43.4-8.3 11.8-4.6 21.7-10.7 31.7-20.6 9.9-9.9 16.1-19.9 20.6-31.7 4.4-11.4 7.4-24.4 8.3-43.4 0.9-19.1 1.1-25.2 1.1-73.8s-0.2-54.7-1.1-73.8c-0.9-19-3.9-32.1-8.3-43.4 -4.6-11.8-10.7-21.7-20.6-31.7 -9.9-9.9-19.9-16.1-31.7-20.6 -11.4-4.4-24.4-7.4-43.4-8.3C310.7 77.3 304.6 77.1 256 77.1L256 77.1z"/><path d="M256 164.1c-50.7 0-91.9 41.1-91.9 91.9s41.1 91.9 91.9 91.9 91.9-41.1 91.9-91.9S306.7 164.1 256 164.1zM256 315.6c-32.9 0-59.6-26.7-59.6-59.6s26.7-59.6 59.6-59.6 59.6 26.7 59.6 59.6S288.9 315.6 256 315.6z"/><circle cx="351.5" cy="160.5" r="21.5"/></g></svg> </span></a> </span> <form action="https://formspree.io/xeqrjbrn" method="POST"> <input type="email" name="replyto" id="Email" placeholder="Mailing List Email" class="email" required> <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://ceodu.github.io/thanks/" /> <input type="submit" value="Join"> </form> </div> </small> </div> <div class="footer-layout-text"> <h1 style="color: #fff; margin:0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing: 0.05rem;">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation</h1> <h1 style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing: 0.05rem; font-size: 3rem;">Delhi University</h1> </div> <div class="footer-layout-copy"> &copy; CEO, Delhi University </div> </footer> <script async src=""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', ''); </script> <!-- Rotator --> </body>
