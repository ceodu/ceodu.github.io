After all, stats also show that one of every 2 startup ideas is going to be a big hit within 5 years of its inception, so it might as well be yours.</p> <p>But in this dynamic environment, it takes a lot to have a successful business, given the level of cut-throat competition that exists today. However, there a lot of factors that affect the success of a startup apart from the competition. This blog talks about some of the mind-boggling fails of some of the best start-ups of their time.</p> <ol> <li>Pets.com</li> </ol> <p>Launched in August 1998, Pets.com was created to sell pet food and accessories via the internet. The premise was that you could ‘buy online and cut out the middleman’ and ‘take advantage of Pets.com’s strong buying power’. Users of the site could browse through different categories; choose products they like and have them conveniently delivered to their home. Think Amazon’s original premise – books – but for pet products.</p> <p>With a cute, if awkward, memorable sock puppet puppy as a mascot and a large marketing budget at launch, this site quickly raised $80M in funding.</p> <p>However, in late 2000, the start-up crashed after burning through $300 million in about twenty-three months. More than three hundred people were laid off when the site was shut down.</p> <p>You must be wondering, where did they go wrong?</p> <p>The startup did not invest in market research and validation of the idea. They made a lot of assumptions like people wanted to buy pet supplies online, that they knew how to and that the supplies were compelling enough that people would be willing to wait for a few days instead of just driving immediately to the nearest pet store and getting it themselves. Hence, the startup touted to be a great one, failed because it was before its time.</p> <ol> <li>Crumbs Bake Shop</li> </ol> <p>Crumbs Bake Shop was once the biggest cupcake vendor in the world. Founded in 2003, the company got its kickstart in response to the then-growing trend of interest in cupcakes. Listed as one of Inc.’s fastest-growing companies, the cupcake chain expanded to many different cities, (79 locations in nine states – New York, Illinois, Virginia, Connecticut, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, New Jersey, Rhode Island, California and Washington, D.C.) with dozens of stores. It offered more than 50 varieties of gourmet cupcakes. But this startup failed because it grew too rapidly, sounds weird, right?</p> <p>The growth was unsustainable for a lot of reasons such as there were too many stores at once with over-optimistic revenue projections and costly leases. Being a single product business, it ought to have proceeded conservatively but it expanded too rapidly, opening a lot of stores throughout. It expanded heavily in Manhattan, and the rental costs there are not very pretty.</p> <p>Also, the company had great unit economics when it opened its first few stores, with more than $1 million in sales per store and units that could be opened anywhere, for $300,000. But thinking that new stores would match these projections and taking risky decisions based on them was their next major blunder.</p> <p>It also laid too much emphasis on just one product – cupcakes, with 80% of its sales coming in from cupcakes only. It had a very weak foundation as it was a single-commodity business, and the cupcakes were clearly just a phase in the US. I mean who needs 50 different types of cupcakes with exclusive brick and mortar stores for them?</p> <p>Thus, the business fell into bankruptcy as soon as the fad of cupcakes passed, in 2014, in the US.</p> <ol> <li>PepperTap</li> </ol> <p>PepperTap was an on-demand hyperlocal grocery delivery start-up based out of Gurgaon. PepperTap began its journey on November 2014 and was founded by Navneet Singh and Milind Sharma. PepperTap was started with a vision to revolutionize grocery shopping: no more queues, no more parking hassles, no more bargaining with sabzi-wallas.</p> <p>They worked on ‘100% Inventory-less’ model, wherein they bought the existing inventory in local stores online to their app. They had a great start, operating in around 31 cities and they were processing, on an average, 20,000 orders per day. They became one of the largest players in India in the online grocery delivery business within a year of operation. They raised a total of $51 million dollars from various investors like Sequoia Capital, SAIF Partners, Snapdeal etc. within 15 months of their operation.</p> <p>Clearly, everything was sunshine and rainbows, so what led to PepperTap shutting its operations starting 2015? The 100% inventory-less model that it boasted about was the thing that led to their failure. E-Commerce in India has a got an image that it has to be cheaper than physical stores for the people to buy. Therefore, the company burnt all its funding on offering discounts. Since it worked on a zero-inventory model, it meant the company had to pay the MRP to local stores; bear the cost of delivery, technology, operations etc. and still, give the products at a discounted price to its customers. There is no way PepperTap could have achieved profitability.</p> <p>For e.g. The start-up raised $51 million in 15 months of operations, i.e., roughly $1,00,000 per day. If they have 20,000 orders per day with the loss of Rs. 200 per order (on discounts and cost of the team), it calculates to a loss of approximately $60,000 per day. The business of raising $1,00,000 per day with a loss of $60,000 per day clearly doesn’t make sense.</p> <p>This fail was a classic case of a business trying to build a beautiful mansion without having fortified its foundation.</p> </p> <p><strong>Recommended</strong> <a href="/blog/overvaluation/">» Overvaluation of Startups </a><br> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="footer" style=" display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(20,5%); grid-template-rows: repeat(20,5%); height: 40vh; "> <div class="footer-social footer-layout-social"> <small class="social"> <div> <span class="icons"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-collegiate-entrepreneurs-organisation-delhi-university/"> <span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0h-14c-2.761 0-5 2.239-5 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762 0 5-2.239 5-5v-14c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zm-11 19h-3v-11h3v11zm-1.5-12.268c-.966 0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zm13.5 12.268h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0v5.604h-3v-11h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476v6.759z"/></svg></span></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ceo_du"> <span class="icon icon--instagram"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><g><path d="M256 109.3c47.8 0 53.4 0.2 72.3 1 17.4 0.8 26.9 3.7 33.2 6.2 8.4 3.2 14.3 7.1 20.6 13.4 6.3 6.3 10.1 12.2 13.4 20.6 2.5 6.3 5.4 15.8 6.2 33.2 0.9 18.9 1 24.5 1 72.3s-0.2 53.4-1 72.3c-0.8 17.4-3.7 26.9-6.2 33.2 -3.2 8.4-7.1 14.3-13.4 20.6 -6.3 6.3-12.2 10.1-20.6 13.4 -6.3 2.5-15.8 5.4-33.2 6.2 -18.9 0.9-24.5 1-72.3 1s-53.4-0.2-72.3-1c-17.4-0.8-26.9-3.7-33.2-6.2 -8.4-3.2-14.3-7.1-20.6-13.4 -6.3-6.3-10.1-12.2-13.4-20.6 -2.5-6.3-5.4-15.8-6.2-33.2 -0.9-18.9-1-24.5-1-72.3s0.2-53.4 1-72.3c0.8-17.4 3.7-26.9 6.2-33.2 3.2-8.4 7.1-14.3 13.4-20.6 6.3-6.3 12.2-10.1 20.6-13.4 6.3-2.5 15.8-5.4 33.2-6.2C202.6 109.5 208.2 109.3 256 109.3M256 77.1c-48.6 0-54.7 0.2-73.8 1.1 -19 0.9-32.1 3.9-43.4 8.3 -11.8 4.6-21.7 10.7-31.7 20.6 -9.9 9.9-16.1 19.9-20.6 31.7 -4.4 11.4-7.4 24.4-8.3 43.4 -0.9 19.1-1.1 25.2-1.1 73.8 0 48.6 0.2 54.7 1.1 73.8 0.9 19 3.9 32.1 8.3 43.4 4.6 11.8 10.7 21.7 20.6 31.7 9.9 9.9 19.9 16.1 31.7 20.6 11.4 4.4 24.4 7.4 43.4 8.3 19.1 0.9 25.2 1.1 73.8 1.1s54.7-0.2 73.8-1.1c19-0.9 32.1-3.9 43.4-8.3 11.8-4.6 21.7-10.7 31.7-20.6 9.9-9.9 16.1-19.9 20.6-31.7 4.4-11.4 7.4-24.4 8.3-43.4 0.9-19.1 1.1-25.2 1.1-73.8s-0.2-54.7-1.1-73.8c-0.9-19-3.9-32.1-8.3-43.4 -4.6-11.8-10.7-21.7-20.6-31.7 -9.9-9.9-19.9-16.1-31.7-20.6 -11.4-4.4-24.4-7.4-43.4-8.3C310.7 77.3 304.6 77.1 256 77.1L256 77.1z"/><path d="M256 164.1c-50.7 0-91.9 41.1-91.9 91.9s41.1 91.9 91.9 91.9 91.9-41.1 91.9-91.9S306.7 164.1 256 164.1zM256 315.6c-32.9 0-59.6-26.7-59.6-59.6s26.7-59.6 59.6-59.6 59.6 26.7 59.6 59.6S288.9 315.6 256 315.6z"/><circle cx="351.5" cy="160.5" r="21.5"/></g></svg> </span></a> </span> <form action="https://formspree.io/xeqrjbrn" method="POST"> <input type="email" name="replyto" id="Email" placeholder="Mailing List Email" class="email" required> <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://ceodu.github.io/thanks/" /> <input type="submit" value="Join"> </form> </div> </small> </div> <div class="footer-layout-text"> <h1 style="color: #fff; margin:0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing: 0.05rem;">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation</h1> <h1 style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing: 0.05rem; font-size: 3rem;">Delhi University</h1> </div> <div class="footer-layout-copy"> &copy; CEO, Delhi University </div> </footer> <script async src=""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', ''); </script> <!-- Rotator --> </body>
