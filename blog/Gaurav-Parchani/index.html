The level of difficulty varies significantly depending on the problem statement, industry associated, deployment strategy and market acceptance. It is especially difficult in healthcare domain due to the following:</p> <p>a) Lack of constant stream of actionable health data. b) Criticality of failures, particularly True Negatives. c) Regulations in the healthcare industry.</p> <p>2) Do you think that the healthcare sector will be dominated by AI in the future? If so, what could be the consequences of it?</p> <p>Definitely. There’s a global shortage of healthcare professionals and this pandemic amplified the gap. The role that AI will play in this industry will be to provide efficiency of patient management by assisting the HCP’s and thus enabling them to cater to a wider set of patients more efficiently. A collaborative of HCP’s and AI can potentially reduce human errors, triage better and ultimately save lives.</p> <p>3) What are some healthcare sector changes that you think are necessary and would like to see in the upcoming years?</p> <p>Regulatory framework needs to evolve for accepting not only AI but modern technology solutions. Along with this the inertia of the already strained healthcare industry towards technology will come down. We’ve already seen higher adoption fo tech solutions by doctors and nursing staff.</p> <p>4) Dozee has a price model which the average Indian cannot easily afford. How did you market and position your product so that even the price sensitive Indian population is convinced to buy it?</p> <p>Healthcare should be available to anyone and anywhere. We’ve built Dozee keeping this in mind. Innovations in the hardware to reduce cost along with the decision of processing all data on the cloud to distribute cost of computation are the key drivers of making our tech affordable. Moreover we’re moving steadily towards a subscription model for remote patient monitoring to further reduce the cost to the patient.</p> <p>5) You mentioned in an interview that you tried to build a rocket when you were in class 8. I think it’s safe to assume that you were the young Sheldon of your time (I hope you have seen The Big Bang Theory). Do tell us more about that story, it sounds very intriguing.</p> <p>That’s very kind of you :). I’ve grown up loving puzzles and therefore pursued engineering. The particular story started when I figured out Calcium carbide when put together with water (Please don’t try this at home) generated acetylene which is flammable. Later that day I also figured out that the welding shop in our locality used calcium carbide for welding. I had all the raw ingredients for building the rocket.</p> <p>6) How was your experience working alongside your Business Partner Mudit Dandwate? Were there ever any clashes in opinion? If so, how did you resolve them?</p> <p>Mudit is the real man of steel, it’s a privilege everyday to be able to work with him. It would be an understatement to say that we have clashes often of multiple topics. At the end of the day we come to a conclusion and stick to it. It’s easy to do this because both of our motivations are to do whatever’s best for Dozee.</p> <p>7) In light of the recent pandemic, what all opportunities do you see as a founder of a startup that deals in the healthcare sector?</p> <p>The first word that comes to mind when you put together the phrases pandemic and healthcare founder is responsibility. We enabled multiple government hospitals to set up thousands of step down ICU beds to manage covid patients. We saw this as our responsibility and not an opportunity. Having said that, this is the best time for a healthcare founder as the pandemic has exposed shortcomings in our healthcare systems, both in India and globally. New solutions and startups are built to solve these problems, what better time to build when the problem is evident in your face.</p> </p> <p><strong>Recommended</strong> <a href="/blog/Neelam-Jain/">» Interview with Neelam Jain </a><br> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="footer" style=" display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(20,5%); grid-template-rows: repeat(20,5%); height: 40vh; "> <div class="footer-social footer-layout-social"> <small class="social"> <div> <span class="icons"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-collegiate-entrepreneurs-organisation-delhi-university/"> <span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0h-14c-2.761 0-5 2.239-5 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762 0 5-2.239 5-5v-14c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zm-11 19h-3v-11h3v11zm-1.5-12.268c-.966 0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zm13.5 12.268h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0v5.604h-3v-11h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476v6.759z"/></svg></span></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ceo_du"> <span class="icon icon--instagram"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><g><path d="M256 109.3c47.8 0 53.4 0.2 72.3 1 17.4 0.8 26.9 3.7 33.2 6.2 8.4 3.2 14.3 7.1 20.6 13.4 6.3 6.3 10.1 12.2 13.4 20.6 2.5 6.3 5.4 15.8 6.2 33.2 0.9 18.9 1 24.5 1 72.3s-0.2 53.4-1 72.3c-0.8 17.4-3.7 26.9-6.2 33.2 -3.2 8.4-7.1 14.3-13.4 20.6 -6.3 6.3-12.2 10.1-20.6 13.4 -6.3 2.5-15.8 5.4-33.2 6.2 -18.9 0.9-24.5 1-72.3 1s-53.4-0.2-72.3-1c-17.4-0.8-26.9-3.7-33.2-6.2 -8.4-3.2-14.3-7.1-20.6-13.4 -6.3-6.3-10.1-12.2-13.4-20.6 -2.5-6.3-5.4-15.8-6.2-33.2 -0.9-18.9-1-24.5-1-72.3s0.2-53.4 1-72.3c0.8-17.4 3.7-26.9 6.2-33.2 3.2-8.4 7.1-14.3 13.4-20.6 6.3-6.3 12.2-10.1 20.6-13.4 6.3-2.5 15.8-5.4 33.2-6.2C202.6 109.5 208.2 109.3 256 109.3M256 77.1c-48.6 0-54.7 0.2-73.8 1.1 -19 0.9-32.1 3.9-43.4 8.3 -11.8 4.6-21.7 10.7-31.7 20.6 -9.9 9.9-16.1 19.9-20.6 31.7 -4.4 11.4-7.4 24.4-8.3 43.4 -0.9 19.1-1.1 25.2-1.1 73.8 0 48.6 0.2 54.7 1.1 73.8 0.9 19 3.9 32.1 8.3 43.4 4.6 11.8 10.7 21.7 20.6 31.7 9.9 9.9 19.9 16.1 31.7 20.6 11.4 4.4 24.4 7.4 43.4 8.3 19.1 0.9 25.2 1.1 73.8 1.1s54.7-0.2 73.8-1.1c19-0.9 32.1-3.9 43.4-8.3 11.8-4.6 21.7-10.7 31.7-20.6 9.9-9.9 16.1-19.9 20.6-31.7 4.4-11.4 7.4-24.4 8.3-43.4 0.9-19.1 1.1-25.2 1.1-73.8s-0.2-54.7-1.1-73.8c-0.9-19-3.9-32.1-8.3-43.4 -4.6-11.8-10.7-21.7-20.6-31.7 -9.9-9.9-19.9-16.1-31.7-20.6 -11.4-4.4-24.4-7.4-43.4-8.3C310.7 77.3 304.6 77.1 256 77.1L256 77.1z"/><path d="M256 164.1c-50.7 0-91.9 41.1-91.9 91.9s41.1 91.9 91.9 91.9 91.9-41.1 91.9-91.9S306.7 164.1 256 164.1zM256 315.6c-32.9 0-59.6-26.7-59.6-59.6s26.7-59.6 59.6-59.6 59.6 26.7 59.6 59.6S288.9 315.6 256 315.6z"/><circle cx="351.5" cy="160.5" r="21.5"/></g></svg> </span></a> </span> <form action="https://formspree.io/xeqrjbrn" method="POST"> <input type="email" name="replyto" id="Email" placeholder="Mailing List Email" class="email" required> <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://ceodu.github.io/thanks/" /> <input type="submit" value="Join"> </form> </div> </small> </div> <div class="footer-layout-text"> <h1 style="color: #fff; margin:0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing: 0.05rem;">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation</h1> <h1 style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing: 0.05rem; font-size: 3rem;">Delhi University</h1> </div> <div class="footer-layout-copy"> &copy; CEO, Delhi University </div> </footer> <script async src=""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', ''); </script> <!-- Rotator --> </body>
