So, let us first understand what a start-up is and how it is different from conventional businesses.</p> <p>According to serial entrepreneur and Silicon Valley legend Steve Blank, a startup is a “temporary organization designed to search for a repeatable and scalable business model.”</p> <p>Although the startup founder and small business owner are both entrepreneurs; the intent, primary function, and funding of their respective business models are radically different</p> <p>A start-up founder intents to change the way ordinary things are done and disrupt the market with a scalable and impactful business model whereas a small business owner intents to be her own boss and secure a place in the market. Both are bootstrapped initially but if a start-up is successful it receives additional series of funding from Angel Investors, Venture Capitalists, Government and even IPO’s (Initial public Offer). With each funding series the founder’s equity erodes while ownership diversifies, whereas in case of a small business all the funds are invested by the founder and the ownership remains intact with him. We are Indians, we love following others!</p> <p>Start-ups were blooming all over the world in 90’s and India was soon a part of this budding ecosystem. The software companies brought about the first wave of change in the early 2000’s when the demand for human resource in the IT sector was huge. But at that time, the dream of opening a startup was only for a rare breed of brave entrepreneurs.</p> <p>The change really occurred when the recession hit the global economy in 2008-09. Though the impact on the Indian economy was not drastic, the pressure was still felt by fresh engineering graduates who had a hefty student loan on their shoulders, but no job offers in hand. Now was the time for people to think different.</p> <p>The cue came from Silicon Valley, and its startup culture. The idea got in synchronization with the Indian ideology of following one’s own dreams and instantly caught imagination of the young minds pursuing management and technical courses.</p> <p>“Follow your dreams or work for someone who did”</p> <p>Today, we can see an entrepreneur as young as 14 and a 45 year-old rising out of his mid life crises. The success of the Silicon Valley Indians – the many millionaires it created – has helped change the Indian mindset towards entrepreneurship. Traditionally a university degree was followed by a job with a large company with whom you stayed till retirement. Only if you were born into a business family were you likely to be an entrepreneur. However, today this model has changed. A university degree may be followed by some practical experience, management training, and a stint at a firm. With this exposure to the world of business we see many Indians now setting up their own ventures which, if unsuccessful, would lead to another venture and hopefully never really retirement.</p> <p>India stands third in the world, not just in the race of Billionaires!</p> <p>The Indian entrepreneurial spirit has risen remarkably as India stands second amongst the fastest growing startup countries worldwide – just after the US, reported NASSCOM. Digitization is playing a vital role in this scenario and has provided ample opportunities to develop Indian online market. In fact semi-urban and rural areas are on their way to get more focus than selected few metro cities.</p> <p>You go girl!</p> <p>Interesting fact is that women entrepreneurs have started to become more prominent in the innovation economy. Several women-run start-ups such as LimeRoad, Kaaryah, Zivame, CashKaro, and media tech companies such as YourStory and POPxo have become success inspirations.</p> <p>Government Initiatives</p> <p>The Indian government defines a startup as an entity less than seven years young with an annual turnover of less than 250 million rupees and headquartered in India. The ‘Startup India’ initiative, by the country’s Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion helps build a positive, effective ecosystem in the country, turning business ideas into a reality for a flourishing startup environment.</p> <p>The Central Department of Science and Technology set up India’s first Start-up Village in Kochi as the first PPP model incubator in 2012. In a huge endorsement of Kochi’s Start-up, a similar project was started in Vishakhapatnam. Many universities, under their entrepreneurship policy, provide grace marks and attendance waivers to encourage budding entrepreneurs. Another significant initiative is the setting up of Start-up boot camps in around 100 engineering colleges.</p> <p>Getting to some stats</p> <p>The startups in India saw a 108 per cent growth in total funding from USD 2 billion in 2017 to USD 4.2 billion in 2018. More than 1,200 startups came up in 2018, including eight unicorns, taking the total number to 7,200. The key growth drivers were enterprise software, fintech, healthtech marketplace and edtech. Data analytics, artificial intelligence and IoT startups have been witnessing fastest adoption across industry, NASSCOM reported.</p> <p>The time is no far when the term ‘start-up’ as a type of business ownership will be found in the NCERT books.</p> </p> <p><strong>Recommended</strong> <a href="/blog/Gaurav-Parchani/">» Interview with Gaurav Parchani </a><br> </p> </article> </div> </main> <footer id="footer" style=" display:grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(20,5%); grid-template-rows: repeat(20,5%); height: 40vh; "> <div class="footer-social footer-layout-social"> <small class="social"> <div> <span class="icons"> <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/the-collegiate-entrepreneurs-organisation-delhi-university/"> <span class="icon icon--twitter"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24"><path d="M19 0h-14c-2.761 0-5 2.239-5 5v14c0 2.761 2.239 5 5 5h14c2.762 0 5-2.239 5-5v-14c0-2.761-2.238-5-5-5zm-11 19h-3v-11h3v11zm-1.5-12.268c-.966 0-1.75-.79-1.75-1.764s.784-1.764 1.75-1.764 1.75.79 1.75 1.764-.783 1.764-1.75 1.764zm13.5 12.268h-3v-5.604c0-3.368-4-3.113-4 0v5.604h-3v-11h3v1.765c1.396-2.586 7-2.777 7 2.476v6.759z"/></svg></span></a> <a href="https://instagram.com/ceo_du"> <span class="icon icon--instagram"><svg viewBox="0 0 512 512"><g><path d="M256 109.3c47.8 0 53.4 0.2 72.3 1 17.4 0.8 26.9 3.7 33.2 6.2 8.4 3.2 14.3 7.1 20.6 13.4 6.3 6.3 10.1 12.2 13.4 20.6 2.5 6.3 5.4 15.8 6.2 33.2 0.9 18.9 1 24.5 1 72.3s-0.2 53.4-1 72.3c-0.8 17.4-3.7 26.9-6.2 33.2 -3.2 8.4-7.1 14.3-13.4 20.6 -6.3 6.3-12.2 10.1-20.6 13.4 -6.3 2.5-15.8 5.4-33.2 6.2 -18.9 0.9-24.5 1-72.3 1s-53.4-0.2-72.3-1c-17.4-0.8-26.9-3.7-33.2-6.2 -8.4-3.2-14.3-7.1-20.6-13.4 -6.3-6.3-10.1-12.2-13.4-20.6 -2.5-6.3-5.4-15.8-6.2-33.2 -0.9-18.9-1-24.5-1-72.3s0.2-53.4 1-72.3c0.8-17.4 3.7-26.9 6.2-33.2 3.2-8.4 7.1-14.3 13.4-20.6 6.3-6.3 12.2-10.1 20.6-13.4 6.3-2.5 15.8-5.4 33.2-6.2C202.6 109.5 208.2 109.3 256 109.3M256 77.1c-48.6 0-54.7 0.2-73.8 1.1 -19 0.9-32.1 3.9-43.4 8.3 -11.8 4.6-21.7 10.7-31.7 20.6 -9.9 9.9-16.1 19.9-20.6 31.7 -4.4 11.4-7.4 24.4-8.3 43.4 -0.9 19.1-1.1 25.2-1.1 73.8 0 48.6 0.2 54.7 1.1 73.8 0.9 19 3.9 32.1 8.3 43.4 4.6 11.8 10.7 21.7 20.6 31.7 9.9 9.9 19.9 16.1 31.7 20.6 11.4 4.4 24.4 7.4 43.4 8.3 19.1 0.9 25.2 1.1 73.8 1.1s54.7-0.2 73.8-1.1c19-0.9 32.1-3.9 43.4-8.3 11.8-4.6 21.7-10.7 31.7-20.6 9.9-9.9 16.1-19.9 20.6-31.7 4.4-11.4 7.4-24.4 8.3-43.4 0.9-19.1 1.1-25.2 1.1-73.8s-0.2-54.7-1.1-73.8c-0.9-19-3.9-32.1-8.3-43.4 -4.6-11.8-10.7-21.7-20.6-31.7 -9.9-9.9-19.9-16.1-31.7-20.6 -11.4-4.4-24.4-7.4-43.4-8.3C310.7 77.3 304.6 77.1 256 77.1L256 77.1z"/><path d="M256 164.1c-50.7 0-91.9 41.1-91.9 91.9s41.1 91.9 91.9 91.9 91.9-41.1 91.9-91.9S306.7 164.1 256 164.1zM256 315.6c-32.9 0-59.6-26.7-59.6-59.6s26.7-59.6 59.6-59.6 59.6 26.7 59.6 59.6S288.9 315.6 256 315.6z"/><circle cx="351.5" cy="160.5" r="21.5"/></g></svg> </span></a> </span> <form action="https://formspree.io/xeqrjbrn" method="POST"> <input type="email" name="replyto" id="Email" placeholder="Mailing List Email" class="email" required> <input type="hidden" name="_next" value="https://ceodu.github.io/thanks/" /> <input type="submit" value="Join"> </form> </div> </small> </div> <div class="footer-layout-text"> <h1 style="color: #fff; margin:0; line-height: 1.2; letter-spacing: 0.05rem;">Collegiate Entrepreneurs Organisation</h1> <h1 style="line-height: 1.2;letter-spacing: 0.05rem; font-size: 3rem;">Delhi University</h1> </div> <div class="footer-layout-copy"> &copy; CEO, Delhi University </div> </footer> <script async src=""></script> <script> window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || []; function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);} gtag('js', new Date()); gtag('config', ''); </script> <!-- Rotator --> </body>
